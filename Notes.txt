Remote Server - Kusal, 3.17.133.26

Our DFS:	KEN (Kusal Ezio Nikola)

Structure:

/ken
	/etc		(private, contains all system related config files)
	/public_root	(public, available as public directory to clients)


/public_root is what clients access/see:
 - all files inside it are placed across several hosts.



1 Nameserver:
- This will index which file is stored where:
	{ "file_identified_by_path" : [ server1_ip, server2_ip, ... ] }



N Clients:
- A client first contacts the nameserver to know where required file is.
- After knowing where the concerned file is, the client connects to that server directly.
- Client performs operation -> Server makes update -> Server immediately calls Nameserver informing about changes.

N Storage Servers:
- Responds to certain commands from Nameserver.
- Contacts nameserver for replication.
- Allows clients to perform certain operations on files it is hosting.

Files:
- Each file is identified by its path in the DFS.


Data will be accessible even if some of the network nodes are offline. ==> Each file has to be in >1 servers.
